Summary
---
I found myself having to migrate our old wiki from twiki to mediawiki. There didn't exist any straightforward tools to do a bulk conversion so I had to use a standalone converter. The only differences in twiki2meiawiki.pl from the original is the format. When I pulled it down from the web everything was on one line.

The very basic convertToMediawiki script takes all given arguments and runs them against the twiki2mediawiki script.

Usage
---
mkdir converted  # Make the converted directory where you plan to run the script
./convertToMediawiki.sh <twiki file(s)>

This source is NOT thouroughly tested. Use at your own risk. I needed a simple solution and this is what I came up with.
